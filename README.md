## config.yml
```yaml
version: '0.X'
# Ticks between each update. Performance cost is extremely small so you are unlikely to run into any
# performance issues even if it is set to 1. Values above 20 can lead to the message fading.
messageUpdateDelay: <number> {Default:5}
# Lower to reduce the delay between entering a bright biome and DefinedHUD changing colors. 
# Very heavy performance impact since MC 1.13. Recommend above 20.
biomeUpdateDelay: <number> {Default:40}
# Colors used by the bright and dark modes respectively (UPPERCASE). https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Formatting_codes
colors:
  bright1: GOLD
  bright2: WHITE
  dark1: DARK_BLUE
  dark2: DARK_AQUA
# Biomes where dark mode will turn on automatically.

## Future Plan
May add the support of version 1.13 in the future. But InfoHUD can also support 1.13 - 1.16 perfectly so this is just a plan.
